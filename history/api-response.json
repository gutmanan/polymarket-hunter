Humanitarian pauses will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nA peace deal or political framework will qualify if it includes a publicly announced and mutually agreed halt in military engagement, effective on a specific date. Frameworks or agreements that outline terms for a future peace but do not include an explicit, dated commitment to stop fighting will not count.\n\nThis market's resolution will be based on official announcements from both Israel and Hamas, however a wide consensus of credible media reporting stating an official ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has been reached will suffice.","resolutionSource":"","startDate":"2025-08-19T00:41:53.593717Z","creationDate":"2025-08-19T00:41:53.593715Z","endDate":"2025-10-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/israel-x-hamas-ceasefire-by-mar-31-2025-u5Otv9fWaIXQ.jpg","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/israel-x-hamas-ceasefire-by-mar-31-2025-u5Otv9fWaIXQ.jpg","active":true,"closed":true,"archived":false,"new":false,"featured":false,"restricted":true,"volume":6659880.871753,"openInterest":0,"createdAt":"2025-08-18T20:04:21.225325Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-10T08:45:11.612655Z","volume1wk":3580734.097002,"volume1mo":6448812.770459997,"volume1yr":6659880.871752998,"enableOrderBook":true,"commentCount":3843,"series":[{"id":"10060","ticker":"israel-x-hamas-ceasefire","slug":"israel-x-hamas-ceasefire","title":"Israel x Hamas ceasefire","seriesType":"single","recurrence":"","image":"","icon":"","active":true,"closed":false,"archived":false,"featured":false,"restricted":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-19T19:37:35.822146Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-12T19:34:17.609253Z","commentCount":9822}],"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2025-10-09T02:01:34Z","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"automaticallyResolved":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"seriesSlug":"israel-x-hamas-ceasefire","negRiskAugmented":false,"featuredOrder":1,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false}],"ready":false,"funded":false,"acceptingOrdersTimestamp":"2025-08-19T00:39:47Z","cyom":false,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"clobRewards":[{"id":"32161","conditionId":"0xacac1a4b66459802a709b2f2eeed96fed8f8982a6fa6a782c3bc29556cc5b5a0","assetAddress":"0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174","rewardsAmount":0,"rewardsDailyRate":1000,"startDate":"2025-08-19","endDate":"2500-12-31"}],"rewardsMinSize":200,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"spread":0.001,"automaticallyResolved":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0.3935,"oneHourPriceChange":0.003,"oneWeekPriceChange":0.7335,"oneMonthPriceChange":0.7635,"lastTradePrice":1,"bestBid":0.998,"bestAsk":0.999,"automaticallyActive":true,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[\"proposed\"]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"deployingTimestamp":"2025-08-19T00:39:16.122509Z","rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false},{"id":"577109","question":"Trump, Putin, and Zelensky meet by August 23?","conditionId":"0x05a504fd23b9f673aa2a96d51f12520d9acbe842a706d103483f1504c06d38fa","slug":"trump-putin-and-zelensky-meet-by-august-23","resolutionSource":"","endDate":"2025-08-23T00:00:00Z","startDate":"2025-08-17T02:30:36.546Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trump-putin-and-zelensky-meet-together-by-august-31-9gdal3QDroDU.jpg","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trump-putin-and-zelensky-meet-together-by-august-31-9gdal3QDroDU.jpg","description":"This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Vladimir Putin, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump all meet together between August 16 and August 23, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.
