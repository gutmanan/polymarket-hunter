    "detailed_reasoning": "The market asks if Hamas will release hostages BY October 12, 2025. Based on comprehensive analysis of all available sources: (1) The 72-hour ceasefire window started Friday October 11 at noon and ends Monday October 13 at noon. (2) Israeli PMO spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian explicitly stated hostages will be released 'early Monday morning'. (3) Hamas official Osama Hamdan confirmed to AFP that releases will begin 'Monday morning'. (4) CNN reports the 20 living hostages will be released 'early on Monday morning, all at the same time'. (5) Times of Israel reports 'release expected to begin Monday morning'. (6) No sources indicate any possibility of release on October 12. The market closes October 12 at 11:59 PM ET, which is before the scheduled Monday morning release. Therefore, NO is the correct outcome with very high confidence."
