    "reasoning_summary": "Multiple credible sources confirm Hamas hostages are scheduled to be released on Monday morning, October 12, 2025 (Israeli time), which falls within the market's deadline of October 12, 11:59 PM ET. The ceasefire began Friday October 10 at 12pm local time, triggering a 72-hour window for Hamas to release hostages (deadline: Monday October 13 at 12pm Israel time / 5am ET). Israeli and Hamas officials have confirmed preparations are underway, hostages have been gathered at three release locations, and the Israeli government expects the release to occur early Monday morning Israeli time, well before the market's 11:59 PM ET cutoff.",
    "detailed_reasoning": "The market resolution criteria requires Hamas to release living Israeli hostages by October 12, 2025, 11:59 PM ET (which is October 13, 6:59 AM Israel time). Based on comprehensive news analysis: (1) A US-brokered ceasefire took effect on October 10, 2025 at 12pm Israel time, (2) The agreement mandates Hamas release 48 hostages (20 believed alive, 28 deceased) within 72 hours of Israeli withdrawal completion, (3) IDF completed initial withdrawal by noon Friday October 10, establishing a 72-hour deadline of Monday October 13 at 12pm Israel time (5am ET), (4) Israeli hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch confirmed in messages to families that releases will begin Monday morning, (5) Hamas officials told Al Jazeera hostages will be released from three locations in Gaza, (6) Senior Israeli officials including PMO spokesperson confirmed readiness for early Monday morning releases, (7) President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner have all publicly confirmed the Monday release timeline. The convergence of official Israeli government statements, Hamas confirmations via mediators, and multiple credible news sources reporting Monday morning releases creates extremely high confidence that at least some living hostages will be released before the market deadline."

    "notes": "Strong conviction YES trade based on convergence of official confirmations from Israeli government, Hamas operational readiness, US diplomatic validation, and successful ceasefire implementation. The 61.5% YES price significantly undervalues the probability given: (1) Formal Israeli government confirmation via hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch, (2) Hamas operational confirmation of hostages gathered at three release locations, (3) 72-hour deadline structure providing 19-hour buffer before market close, (4) Visible operational preparations including Red Cross coordination and prisoner list publication, (5) Trump administration's personal involvement and planned Monday Israel visit. Key risk is Hamas delay tactics, but unprecedented international pressure and successful 3-day ceasefire suggest high probability of Monday morning release (Israel time) which would occur well before market deadline. Market may be overweighting historical Hamas delay precedent versus current unique circumstances. Time-sensitive trade - enter immediately as release could begin within hours.",

The convergence of evidence is overwhelming: Israeli government has formally notified families of Monday morning release, Hamas has confirmed hostages are gathered and ready, Red Cross is coordinating handover, and the 72-hour deadline structure provides substantial buffer before market close. The market's 61.5% YES pricing appears to reflect undue caution based on Hamas's historical delay tactics, but current circumstances are unprecedented with direct US presidential involvement, Trump planning Monday Israel visit, and international summit scheduled. The key insight is timezone alignment: 'Monday morning' Israel time translates to Sunday evening/Monday morning ET, providing nearly 24 hours before the Sunday 11:59 PM ET market close. Even significant delays would likely occur within the market window. This represents a high-conviction YES trade with strong risk-reward at current 61.5% pricing.",
