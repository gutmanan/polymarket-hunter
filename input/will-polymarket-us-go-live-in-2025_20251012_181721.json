    "reasoning_summary": "Despite strong regulatory progress including QCEX acquisition and CFTC no-action letter, the US government shutdown since October 1 has halted all CFTC self-certification processing. Polymarket filed self-certifications on October 1 for sports and election contracts intended to launch October 2, but these have not appeared on the CFTC public portal. Historical precedent shows the CFTC stays self-certifications during shutdowns. With the shutdown entering its second week with no resolution in sight and only 11 weeks remaining in 2025, time constraints make a 2025 launch highly unlikely even if the shutdown ends soon.",
    "detailed_reasoning": "The market requires a real-money trade on a Polymarket-operated DCM by December 31, 2025. While Polymarket completed the QCEX acquisition in July 2025 and received CFTC no-action letter on September 3, the critical self-certification filings submitted October 1 remain unprocessed due to the government shutdown. The CFTC has only 31 of 543 employees working (5.7%), and past precedent indicates self-certifications are stayed during shutdowns. Even if the shutdown ends by late October (which current negotiations suggest is unlikely), Polymarket would still need CFTC processing time, technical implementation, and actual trade execution - all within the remaining weeks of 2025. The current YES price of 96.9% appears to significantly overestimate the probability given these substantial obstacles."

Current YES price of 96.9% appears significantly mispriced relative to realistic 20-25% probability. However, market has remained stubbornly bullish, suggesting potential for irrational pricing to persist. Recommend modest position size due to: (1) Possibility of CFTC Acting Chair policy change, (2) Unknown shutdown duration, (3) High market conviction in YES outcome. Best entry would be on any positive shutdown news that temporarily drives NO price higher. Consider scaling in gradually.",

The market pricing of 96.9% YES appears to dramatically underestimate these obstacles. Key monitoring points: (1) Senate negotiations after October 15 reconvening, (2) Any CFTC Acting Chair statements on certification policy, (3) Shutdown resolution timing. The combination of political gridlock, regulatory freeze, and compressed timeline creates a compelling case for the NO outcome despite Polymarket's otherwise strong positioning for eventual US entry.",
